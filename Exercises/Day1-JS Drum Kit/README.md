# Day1-JS Drum Kit


An HTML page displays a collection of `div` elements, each containing a letter
that corresponds with a key on the keyboard, and the name of the soundclip to be
played when that button is clicked.
When a user presses a key that matches one of the letters displayed in the `div` elements,
the page should play the corresponding soundclip and place a temporary 'highlight' (or border)
around the `div`.
