# Day5-Flex Panel Gallery

For this exercise, we are given a web page with five `div` HTML elements with a class `panels`, 
each containing three `p` HTML elements with some text.
These five `div` elements are wrapped inside another `div` element with a class `panel`.
Currently, these divs are stacked vertically and aren't interactive. 
We want to display these divs vertically and have only the middle `p` element of each `div` displayed.
When a user clicks on a particular `div` element we want to expand that element and bring the two other `p` elements back into view. 

## Guide

Update the CSS and write the JavaScript code necessary to bring this interactivity to the page.

Most of this challenge focuses on working with _CSS3 flexible boxes_, or flexbox. 
If you're unfamiliar with flexible boxes, here's another free course provided by Wes Bos:

**SIDENOTE:** I broke up the CSS for this challenge into a separate file because that
made it easier to focus on the pieces that I was working with.
