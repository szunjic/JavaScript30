# Day8-Fun With HTML5 Canvas

We're given an HTML page with a `canvas` element in which the user should be able
to click and drag their mouse to draw. 
When the user clicks+drags their mouse, they should see a line being drawn out on the canvas that starts from the original
mouse location and ends where the user released the mouse click. 
This line should be multicolor, and should increase and decrease in width.
