    // ## Array Cardio Day 2

    const people = [
      { name: 'Wes', year: 1988 },
      { name: 'Kait', year: 1986 },
      { name: 'Irv', year: 1970 },
      { name: 'Lux', year: 2015 }
    ];

    const comments = [
      { text: 'Love this!', id: 523423 },
      { text: 'Super good', id: 823423 },
      { text: 'You are the best', id: 2039842 },

      { text: 'Nice Nice Nice!', id: 542328 }
    ];

    // Some and Every Checks
    // Array.prototype.some() // is at least one person 19 or older?

      // .some() will check if at least one thing in your array meets what you're looking for
        // Takes a function that will check it for every single one that we have (in this case, that is going to give us our person )

      const isAdult = people.some(function(person) {
        // Need the current year
        const currentYear = (new Date()).getFullYear();
        // If currentYear - person.year is >= 19, then return true
        if(currentYear - person.year >= 19) {
          return true; 
        }
      });

      // And it should return true becauser there is at least one person in that array that s older than 19
      console.log(isAdult);

      // THIS CAN BE MADE A LOT SIMPLER:
      // *** By converting it to an arrow function with an implicit return
      const isAdult2 = people.some(person => ((new Date()).getFullYear()) - person.year >= 19);
      console.log(isAdult2);

    // Array.prototype.every() // is everyone 19 or older?

      // Simply take the condensed solution from the problem above
      // And replace .some with .every 
      const allAdults = people.every(person => ((new Date()).getFullYear()) - person.year >= 19);
      console.log(allAdults);
      // Check the console, we get FALSE -- bc not every single item in the array meets our criteris 


      // RECAP:
        // .some() will check if ONE ITEM meets the criteria 
        // .every() will check if EVERY SINGLE ITEM meets the critiers 


    // Array.prototype.find()  // find the comment with the ID of 823423
    
      // Find is like filter, but instead of returning a subset of the array,
      // it's going to return just the item you are looking for

      // Call .find() on the comments array
        // Run a function against it which will give us the "comment"
      const comment = comments.find(function(comment) {
        if (comment.id === 823423) {
          return true;
        }
      });
      console.log(comment);
      // Check the console, and we get that one specific comment "Super good"

      // THIS CAN BE MADE A LOT SIMPLER:
      // *** By converting it to an arrow function with an implicit return

      const comment2 = comments.find(comment => comment.id === 823423);
      console.log(comment2);
      

    // Array.prototype.findIndex() // Find and delete the comment with the ID of 823423

      // .findIndex() is used when you want to find where something is inside of the array 
    
      // In order to delete something from an array, you need to know WHERE in the array it is
      // All we got is this ID of 823423

      // We do exactly what we did the problem above..
      const index = comments.findIndex(comment => comment.id === 823423);
      // And then console.log the index
      console.log(index)
      // It tells us it is index 1 (which means it's the 2nd item in the array)

      // Now to delete it, there are 2 ways

      // 1) We could use .splice:

      // comments.splice(index, 1);
      // console.table(comments);
      // We see that the "Super good" (ID of 823423) comment is gone 

      // 2) OR, we could create new array of the updated comments -- ** Very popular in the REDUX world

      // Create a new array 
      const newComments = [
        // Take a copy of the comments before it 
          // Spread the items into the new array,
          // Start at 0, and we go until the index
        ...comments.slice(0, index),
          // Spread the items into the new array,
          // Then start at the index + 1, and go until the end so we don't pass anything 
        ...comments.slice(index + 1)
      ];
      // And that's just going to a build a NEW array of the comments
      console.table(newComments);
      // We see that the "Super good" (ID of 823423) comment is gone 
      // And with the .splice() solution commented out, we can still see the old array with the "Super good" comment still there 
      console.table(comments)
