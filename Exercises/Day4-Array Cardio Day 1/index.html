    // Some data we can work with

    const inventors = [
      { first: 'Albert', last: 'Einstein', year: 1879, passed: 1955 },
      { first: 'Isaac', last: 'Newton', year: 1643, passed: 1727 },
      { first: 'Galileo', last: 'Galilei', year: 1564, passed: 1642 },
      { first: 'Marie', last: 'Curie', year: 1867, passed: 1934 },
      { first: 'Johannes', last: 'Kepler', year: 1571, passed: 1630 },
      { first: 'Nicolaus', last: 'Copernicus', year: 1473, passed: 1543 },
      { first: 'Max', last: 'Planck', year: 1858, passed: 1947 },
      { first: 'Katherine', last: 'Blodgett', year: 1898, passed: 1979 },
      { first: 'Ada', last: 'Lovelace', year: 1815, passed: 1852 },
      { first: 'Sarah E.', last: 'Goode', year: 1855, passed: 1905 },
      { first: 'Lise', last: 'Meitner', year: 1878, passed: 1968 },
      { first: 'Hanna', last: 'Hammarstr√∂m', year: 1829, passed: 1909 }
    ];

    const people = ['Beck, Glenn', 'Becker, Carl', 'Beckett, Samuel', 'Beddoes, Mick', 'Beecher, Henry', 'Beethoven, Ludwig', 'Begin, Menachem', 'Belloc, Hilaire', 'Bellow, Saul', 'Benchley, Robert', 'Benenson, Peter', 'Ben-Gurion, David', 'Benjamin, Walter', 'Benn, Tony', 'Bennington, Chester', 'Benson, Leana', 'Bent, Silas', 'Bentsen, Lloyd', 'Berger, Ric', 'Bergman, Ingmar', 'Berio, Luciano', 'Berle, Milton', 'Berlin, Irving', 'Berne, Eric', 'Bernhard, Sandra', 'Berra, Yogi', 'Berry, Halle', 'Berry, Wendell', 'Bethea, Erin', 'Bevan, Aneurin', 'Bevel, Ken', 'Biden, Joseph', 'Bierce, Ambrose', 'Biko, Steve', 'Billings, Josh', 'Biondo, Frank', 'Birrell, Augustine', 'Black, Elk', 'Blair, Robert', 'Blair, Tony', 'Blake, William'];

    // Array.prototype.filter()
    // 1. Filter the list of inventors for those who were born in the 1500's

      // How filter works: 
        // You pass it a function
        // And that function is going to loop over every single item in the array (in this case, inventors array)
        // And its going to give us the inventor (which we pass it)

      // Get people who were born in the 1500's, and filter over it 
      const fifteen = inventors.filter(function(inventor) {
        // We take the inventors array, we loop over it, 
        // and for each inventor we can decide whether we wanna keep it or not (w this if/else statement)
        if (inventor.year >= 1500 && inventor.year < 1600) {
          return true; 
          // By returning true, that means we keep it 
        }
        // No need for and 'else' to return 'false'
      });

      console.log(fifteen);
      console.table(fifteen);

    // THIS SOLUTION CAN BE GREATLY REDUCED/SIMPLIFIED:
      // Use an arrow function, and bc its just returning true or false, do everything in-line:
      const fifteen2 = inventors.filter(inventor => (inventor.year >= 1500 && inventor.year < 1600))
      console.log(fifteen2);



    // Array.prototype.map()
    // 2. Give us an array of the inventors' first and last names

      // How map works:
        // Map takes in an array 
        // Does something with that array 
        // Returns a NEW array, but of the same length
          // Map will always return the same amount of items as you give it 

      // From the inventor we passed it, we are going to return the first and last name
      // To fix the spacing problem: concatinate a space: ' '
      const fullNames = inventors.map(inventor => inventor.first + ' ' + inventor.last)
      console.log(fullNames);

    // Array.prototype.sort()
    // 3. Sort the inventors by birthdate, oldest to youngest

      // How sort works:
        // You get 2 items 
        // You're asked to sort just those 2 items 
        // Is person A older than person B?
          // And if so you put the older person on top
          // And then way that we do that is by returning 1 and -1 
          // And thats going to bubble these items up and down in the array

      // This function in sort is going to give us the first person and the second person (a & b)
      const ordered = inventors.sort(function(a, b) {
        if (a.year > b.year) {
          return 1;
        } else {
          return -1; // And that 1/-1 is just gonna move these items up and down in the array 
        }
      });
      console.table(ordered);

      // THIS SOLUTION CAN BE GREATLY REDUCED/SIMPLIFIED:
      // By using in-line arrow functions and 'turnaray?' function, which is a shorthand if statement
      const ordered2 = inventors.sort((a, b) => a.year > b.year ? 1 : -1) 
      // If a is greater than b, return 1, otherwise, return -1
      console.table(ordered2);


    // Array.prototype.reduce()
    // 4. How many years did all the inventors live?

      // How a reduce works:
        // Whereas sort and map take items in and sort them or turn them into something else or filter then down
        // A reduce allows you to build sometihng on every single one 
        // Just a much cleaner way of altering a variable with a for loop?

        // Remember, all these functions (reduce, sort, filter) they just loop over every single one

        // Reduce will give you sorta like your running total, or what you've returned from this function last time (calling that total) and the inventor 
      const totalYears = inventors.reduce((total, inventor) => {
        // Gonna return the total (what the total was last time around) 
        // and then we're gonna return the total number of years that inventor had lived
        return total + (inventor.passed - inventor.year);
      }, 0); // ** MUST add this 0 here because before 'total' was undefiend 
      console.log(totalYears);


    // 5. Sort the inventors by years lived

      const oldest = inventors.sort(function(a, b) {
        // Before returning the 1 and -1,
        // we're gonna create some variables to use in our if statement 
        const lastGuy = a.passed - a.year; 
        const nextGuy = b.passed - b.year;

        if (lastGuy > nextGuy) {
          return -1 
        } else {
          return 1
        }
      }); 
      console.table(oldest);

      // THIS SOLUTION CAN BE GREATLY REDUCED/SIMPLIFIED:
      // By using the short hand for if/else statements
      const oldest2 = inventors.sort(function(a, b) {
        const lastGuy = a.passed - a.year; 
        const nextGuy = b.passed - b.year;
        return lastGuy > nextGuy ? -1 : 1;
      }); 
      console.table(oldest2);


// *** Had to comment out solutions for this #6 exercise because #7 would show errors
    // 6. create a list of Boulevards in Paris that contain 'de' anywhere in the name
    // https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Boulevards_in_Paris

      // First need to get the DOM elements out of the page
      // Second we filter that list of names for only ones that include "de"

      // Getting the DOM elements out of the page 
        // In the console..
          // document.querySelector but we don't know what to select
        // So we need to open Dev tools, Inspect whatever contains all of the data
          // <div class="mw-category">
        // In the console ..
          // const category = document.querySelector('.mw-category');
          // 'category' and <div class="mw-category"> should show up 

//      const category = document.querySelector('.mw-category');
      // Now we wanna find the links within it
//      const links = [...category.querySelectorAll('a')];
      // **Remember: You can call querySelector on any exisiting DOM element, it doesnt always have to be document; It can look inside of an exisitng element 
      // **So we're using querySelector here to look INSIDE of category for links ('a')
      // **Using ES6 SPREAD [...] to spread every single item into the array 

      // In the console..
        // const links = category.querySelectorAll('a')
        // 'links' and we get a list of all the links on the page 

      // First we convert that list of links to a list of names 
        // Take in a list of links, and kick out a list of names
        // Map over each one, pass it a link, and from that link just return link.textContent
          // And that will give us just the text inside that rather than the entire link
//      const de = links
//                  .map(link => link.textContent);
//                  .filter(streetName => streetName.inclides('de'));
                // **If we type this in the console, we get an error
                  // Bc the list of links we got back is a NodeList (const links)
                  // So we need to go back (to const links) and make it an array
                  // We convert it into an array by inserting an ES6 spread [...]
                    // SPREADS just spread every single item into the array (see line 162)
                    // A Spread will take everything outside of an item (in this case the NodeList) and puts it into an array              
               // Go back into the console.. (first refresh and redefine variables)
                // const de = links.map(link => link.textContent);
                // 'de' and we get huge array of every single one 
      // So now we're just gonna immeditely filter that array for only those that include 'de'
//              .filter(streetName => streetName.inclides('de'));
      // Only return if the streetName includes 'de'

      // Go back into the console.. (first refresh and redefine variables)
        // Now we have a subset of that initial array only containing those with 'de'

      // This is what the **REAL SOLUTION** should look like (without all my comments):

      // const category = document.querySelector('.mw-category');
      // const links = Array.from(category.querySelectorAll('a'));
      // const de = links
      //             .map(link => link.textContent)
      //             .filter(streetName => streetName.includes('de'));



    // 7. sort Exercise
    // Sort the people alphabetically by last name

      // No longer using the 'inventors' array
      // Now working with the 'people' array

      // Sort over people with a function, and we're going to get the lastOne and nextOne
        // Don't care about returning anything just yet
        // Just gonna console.log the 'lastOne' just to see what we're working with (must comment out the solution to #6 to remove the inital error we get)
      const alpha = people.sort(function(lastOne, nextOne) {
        // console.log(lastOne)
        // What we really want is to convert this to a first name and a last name, so..
        // We're gonna split it on is a comma and a space (, )
        // const parts = lastOne.split(', ')
        // console.log(parts);
        // Now we get an array we're the first thing is the last name and the second thing is the first name
          // This is a little backwards
          // So we can do is DESTRUCTURE that, meaning that:
          // Rather than return an array with const parts, we can put those into their own variables right away, like this:
        const [aLast, aFirst] = lastOne.split(', ');
        console.log(aLast, aFirst);
        // Now we have some proper variables to work with 
        // Now we do it with the nextOne
        const [bLast, bFirst] = nextOne.split(', ');
        // Now we have the last person and the next person
        // Now what we really care about in this case is the last name:
        // if aLast is > bLast return -1 otherwise return 1
        return aLast > bLast ? 1 : -1;
      });
      console.log(alpha); // Now its sorted by last name (Beck is the first one, Blake is the last one)
      // ** Note: 



    // 8. Reduce Exercise
    // Sum up the instances of each of these
    const data = ['car', 'car', 'truck', 'truck', 'bike', 'walk', 'car', 'van', 'bike', 'walk', 'car', 'van', 'car', 'truck' ];
    // ** Reduce is one of the most flexible methods in an array, and this is just another way that we can use it

    // Passing our reduce a funtion with an object and item (obj, item)
    const transportation = data.reduce(function(obj, item) {
     // Checking for keys in obj
      // If there is no obj[item], then obj[item] = 0
      // This will set the inital one to 0.. 
      if(!obj[item]) {
        obj[item] = 0
      }
      //..and then we can increment it and return that object
      obj[item]++;
      // console.log(item);
      return obj; // We get every single item when we loop over it
       

    }, {}) // **We need to start with a blank object

    console.log(transportation);

    //*** Review of what we did with the reduce method here:
      // We start with a blank object
      // And then everytime we loop over one, we first check if theres even a 0 there to work with at all(line 252)
        // If not we need to make an entry for that (line 253)
        // And then we can go ahead and increment it (line 256)
